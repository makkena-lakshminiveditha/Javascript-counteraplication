🧮Counter Application
The Counter Application is a beginner-friendly project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
This project is ideal for those starting with JavaScript fundamentals, as it covers event handling, UI updates, and logic building in a simple and practical way.
✨ Features
* ➕ Increase – Increments the counter value by 1
* ➖ Decrease – Decrements the counter value by 1 (doesn’t go below 0)
* 🔄 Reset – Resets the counter back to 0
Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned and practiced:
* Understanding how the DOM works like a tree structure
* Using getElementById to access and manipulate elements
* Handling events (like button clicks) in JavaScript
* Updating the UI dynamically without refreshing the page
* Writing clean, reusable functions for small tasks
Project Structure

│── index.html   # HTML file (structure of the app)
│── index.css    # CSS file (styling and design)
│── index.js     # JavaScript file (logic and functionality)
│── README.md    # Project documentation
How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
